## Implementation Notes

### 1) Do Not Collapse Brands
Each is distinct:
- Magic Unicorn = Studio
- Unicorn Commander = Infrastructure Platform
- Center Deep = Intelligence Layer
- Cognitive Companion = Application Layer
- Cipher Forge Forward / Genesis Flow = Accelerator Companies

### 2) Avoid "SaaS Company" Language on Magic Unicorn

**No:**
- "Pricing plans"
- "Buy now"
- "Sign up for a free trial"

**Yes:**
- "Engage"
- "Co-build"
- "Architect"
- "Explore the ecosystem"

### 3) Modular Content Blocks
All platform sections should be:
- Reusable
- Expandable
- Capable of becoming standalone product pages later

### 4) Future-Proofing
Support for:
- Additional accelerator companies
- New product platforms
- A future marketplace or agent ecosystem
- Lead-gen pipelines feeding into Center Deep

### 5) Technical Orientation
Assume future integration of:
- Dashboards
- APIs
- Documentation portals
- Open-source repositories
- Developer onboarding

This is not a brochure site. It's an operating surface.

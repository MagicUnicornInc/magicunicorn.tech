## 2. About the Studio

### Opening Narrative

**Page Headline:**
"About Magic Unicorn"

**Page Subheadline:**
"A technology studio that builds systems, not products."

**Opening Paragraph:**
```
Magic Unicorn Unconventional Technology & Stuff Inc. exists because most AI infrastructure shouldn't require a subscription, a vendor relationship, or surrendering control of your data.

We build AI platforms, automation systems, and production infrastructure that organizations can actually own. Not rent. Not license. Own.

The whimsical name is intentional. It's a strategic wrapper around deep engineering, operations discipline, and an unusually broad skill range. Serious systems can feel approachable without sacrificing capability.
```

### Philosophy Section

**Section Headline:**
"How We Think About Building"

**Philosophy Points (Cards or List):**

**1. Systems-of-Systems Thinking**
- **Copy:** "Most vendors sell apps. We build ecosystems: interoperable services, shared identity, shared observability, shared deployment patterns, repeatable automation, and coherent UX across a cluster of tools. One control plane, many capabilities."

**2. Open-Source First (But Pragmatic)**
- **Copy:** "Open-source isn't ideology. It's operational strategy — transparency, modifiability, community leverage, and long-term survivability. If something proprietary is unavoidable, it becomes a swappable layer, not a single point of failure."

**3. Hardware-Aware AI**
- **Copy:** "Unlike typical SaaS AI, we design around real compute: GPUs, NPUs, iGPUs, memory constraints, containerization, and predictable performance. Inference is infrastructure, not magic."

**4. Operator Experience as Product**
- **Copy:** "Dashboards, control planes, setup scripts, and automation flows are first-class product features. The goal isn't just AI that works — it's AI that feels manageable, predictable, and trustworthy."

### Open-Source Stance Section

**Section Headline:**
"On Open Source and Sovereignty"

**Body Copy:**
```
Magic Unicorn is strongly aligned with open-source as both ethical position and operational advantage.

We believe in:
- Transparency over opacity
- Modifiability over permission
- Community leverage over vendor dependency
- Long-term survivability over quarterly roadmaps

Our flagship platforms — Ops-Center, portions of Unicorn Commander, and our deployment patterns — are open-source by design. The goal is simple: don't get boxed in.

When we use proprietary components (and sometimes we must), they're positioned as swappable layers. Never single points of failure. Never leverage someone else holds over you.
```

### Founder Introduction Section

**Section Headline:**
"The Architect Behind the Studio"

**Founder Card:**

**Name:** Aaron Stransky
**Title:** Founder & Unconventional Technologist

**Bio Copy:**
```
Aaron Stransky is the founder and driving force behind Magic Unicorn. His defining strength is systems thinking — he doesn't approach AI, software, or infrastructure as isolated tools, but as components of cohesive environments where compute, models, data, identity, orchestration, and user experience function as a unified whole.

Aaron leads the architecture of Unicorn Commander, Ops-Center, and the broader platform ecosystem. He brings a background in AI infrastructure, deployment engineering, hardware-aware optimization, and multi-tenant system architecture.

A U.S. military veteran, Aaron's emphasis on reliability, preparation, and clear roles is visible throughout Magic Unicorn's platforms. He favors systems that reduce cognitive load rather than adding to it — tools that make operators confident, not confused.

He describes his role not as CEO, but as an "Unconventional Technologist" — someone focused on solving hard, interconnected problems that others avoid because they sit between disciplines.
